# Singapore Changi Airport App

My third week homework project for the Skill Distillery project "Jets."

### Overview

This is a console based app that lets the user run a mini Changi airport. 

### Topics and Technologies

#### Object Oriented Programming:
This program contains an abstract class and two interfaces from which further classes are derived.

#### File input:
The Airfield class contains an ArrayList of Jets which is populated using a text file jet database.

### Lessons Learned
I had fun writing and getting [JetsApplication]'s removeJet(), [Airfield]'s jetMenu(), and [AirField]'s removeJet() working together.  It was cool to see them supporting each other!
